This project is building a generator of binary program code and data stream code, they will be passed to a data-driven processor.

I have done some work on the generation, and I hope I can find a way to buid a DDP simulator module instead of using the real hardware chip or the circuit simulation tools.

Also, it is supposed to be a DSL in the future release.
